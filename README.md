Genome sequencing technologies, over the past 10-15 years, have significantly reduced the cost of sequencing the genome. In 2003, the human genome was sequenced for the first time for 2,700 million dollars with the Human Genome Project (HGP), which began in 1990 and ended in 2003 with the collaboration of research centers around the world. Today it can be sequenced for around 1,200 dollars in about 1 month and it is expected that in the next few years the cost will fall below 100 dollars.
This has made sequencing become a tool commonly used in medicine, which has led to a rapid accumulation of genomic data. 

This genomic information is contained in the base sequence of the nucleotides that make up the DNA and can be used for different purposes: research, genetic analysis, precision medicine, family search, forensic, etc. Therefore, it must also be properly stored, transferred and, above all, protected, which has become a general problem and has led to the development of specific compression tools for genomic data.

Different formats are used today to store this information (FASTQ, SAM, BAM, etc), each with different compression ratios and different areas of use, but the new demands have made the committee
MPEG standardization (ISO / IEC JTC1 SC29 / WG11) develop a new standard for the safe compression of genomic data, which compared to the previous formats will offer greater compression, better metadata support and a better integration of security practices. 

The objective of this project is to implement a first version of this standard for internal use of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) and propose improvements for future development.
