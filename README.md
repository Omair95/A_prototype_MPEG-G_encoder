The MPEG standardization committee (ISO/IEC JTC1 SC29/WG11) is working in the specification of a standard for secure compression of genomic data. A first stable version will be available soon. With respect to current formats, this new format, known as MPEG-G, will provide higher compression, simplified direct access, better metadata support, and integration of security strategies. The standard specifies how to decode a MPEG-G file, but not how to encode it, since this is open for possible optimization. The objective of this proposed work is to implement a MPEG-G encoder to translate from files available in current formats. This will include deciding which subsets of the file to consider and implementing a tool to describe the data in a byte stream that is compatible with the standard. Furthermore, since the standard will not be in a final status yet, errors could be found and they will be reported back to the standardization committee. Collaboration with developers from international organizations is expected.
